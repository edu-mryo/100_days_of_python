# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
# You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.
# e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.
# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.
