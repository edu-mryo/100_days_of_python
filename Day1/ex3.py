# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. 
# You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
# The screen should show "What if Your Name?". You must input your name in the terminal and the result should return the length of the input
# eg What is your name? Mark -> 4

print(len(input("What is Your Name? ")))
